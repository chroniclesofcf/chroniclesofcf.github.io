          <h2 class="post-title">Vettel out? Alonso to return? Silly season begins</h2>
          <div class="post-content">
           <p>This season of the Formula 1 travel circus hasn't got off to a great start.<br>
              What is usually a specatacle of 10 teams and 20 drivers battling it out on track<br>
              for supremecy has been diluted to empty grand stands and terrible business decisions.<br>
              It's not all dark clouds and flat tires though as the driver market is about to spice<br>
              up this drought of exciting races we've endured. With many of the drivers contracts<br>
              running out at the end of this season, we expect to see some movement in the driver market,<br>
              possibly even some wildcards.</p>

           <p><img src="vettel.jpg" alt="Sebastian Vettel" style="float:right;margin-left:5px;clear:left;">
              As early as Australia last year, the rumour mills been churning stories of
              Sebastian Vettel's contract and Lewis Hamilton on a possible move to Ferrari. News broke
              earlier this year that Vettel had been offered a one-year extensions but at a substantial
              pay cut. News broke recently of Vettel declining the contract from Ferrari branding it a
              "joke" at £12m for the year. A far cry from his usual 3 year contracts at £40m anually.
              There's many reasons Vettel could have refused to sign the contract and looking into
              it begins to reveal the cracks reminiscent of his last year at Red Bull.</p>

           <p><img src="alonso.jpg" alt="Fernando Alonso" style="float:left;margin-right:5px;clear:right;">
              Ferrari have began to make a short list of drivers suited to replace Vettel in the
              case they can't come to an agreement on a contract that suits them both. On the list
              are names like Daniel Ricciardo, Carlos Sainz and Antonio Giovinazzi. According to
              F1-Insider.com, two time world champion and ex Ferrari driver, Fernando Alonso, has even
              thrown his hat into the ring, putting himself forward as a replacement for Vettel.</p>

           <p>With the season on hold till later this year, now is the time for negotiations to happen.<br>
              Their be plenty more news around contracts but take everything with a bucket of salt until<br>
              it all comes to fruition.</p>
